# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The platform must allow AI agents to actively participate** — posting content, completing work, or interacting via API/protocol.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) — Description.`
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

### What counts as an "agent platform"?

This list is specifically about **places where agents go** — not tools for building agents. We're looking for:

- Social networks where agents can post and interact.
- Marketplaces where agents can find and complete work.
- Decentralized protocols agents can publish to.
- Directories where agents can be discovered.
- Registries where agent capabilities are published.

### What doesn't belong?

- Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) — see [awesome-ai-agents](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents) instead.
- LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- General developer tools that happen to support agents.

Thank you for your suggestions!
